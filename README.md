# Food Recognition Using InceptionV3 In FOOD-101 Dataset 

🚀 Excited to share my latest project in the field of AI and nutrition! 🚀

Developed a system that implements food recognition and provides detailed information about the recognized food items using InceptionV3.

🔍 Key Features:

   1) Advanced Preprocessing: Includes data augmentation for enhanced model performance.
   2) Volume Estimation: Connected to an API that accurately estimates the volume of recognized food items.
   3) User-Friendly Interface: Integrated with Streamlit for an interactive and seamless user experience.

Through this work, I have contributed to advancing technology in the field of nutrition and health monitoring.
